The Demand for Recognition (Exhibit B) lists the following “Included” and “Excluded”
classifications:
Employees Included: All full time and part time Chief Engineers, Assistant Chief
Engineers, Stationary Engineers and Utility Engineers.
Employees Excluded: All other classifications, including but not limited to guards,
managers, confidential employees and supervisors as defined by the Act.
Excluded:
Despite the above, the RM Petitioner, Jones Lang LaSalle (the “Employer”), does not have job
classifications that correspond to the listed titles of “Chief Engineers, Assistant Chief Engineers,
Stationary Engineers and Utility Engineers.” The Employer believes the International Union of
Operating Engineers, Local 39 (the “Union”) has filed a deficient RC Petition that must
necessarily be withdrawn.
Subject to, and notwithstanding the above, to the extent the Union’s RC Petition refers to
Maintenance Managers, the Employer contends that all Maintenance Managers must be excluded
from the unit, because they are supervisors pursuant to Section 2(11) of the National Labor
Relations Act (the “Act”). 29 U.S.C. §§ 152(11). There are 21 Maintenance Managers who lead
and supervise a team of Facilities Technicians and oversee the maintenance and repair activities
for a campus of buildings. The Maintenance Managers are the Facilities Technicians’ direct
managers who manage and supervise the Facilities Technicians and assign daily work orders and
workloads to them. In addition to managing their day-to-day work, the Maintenance Managers
manage the performance, hiring and firing, and perform other managerial duties over the
Facilities Technicians. They also mentor Facilities Technicians, providing guidance, training,
and support to enhance their performance and career growth.
The Employer also contends that all other employees, including, but not limited to, guards,
managers, confidential employees, and supervisors as defined by the Act must be excluded.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"International Union of Operating Engineers, Stationary Engineers, Local 39, AFL-CIO"
