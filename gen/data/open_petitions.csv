Atlantic Theater reserves the right to present evidence and testimony to support the exclusion of
the Production Manager, Technical Director, and Lighting Supervisor (the “Identified
Supervisors”), or any other managerial or supervisory employees challenged, from the bargaining
unit. If IATSE objects to the exclusion of the Identified Supervisors from the unit, then Atlantic
Theater requests a hearing and decision on this issue prior to any election. A resolution prior to
any election is critical given the Identified Supervisors’ supervisory responsibilities, and their
necessary involvement in any campaign Atlantic Theater conducts during an election. Atlantic
Theater will not be able to proceed without first confirming the supervisory status of the Identified
Supervisors, due to the potential consequences now articulated in Cemex. That is, the risk of
getting an unfair labor practice charge, and according to Cemex, a bargaining order if the Identified
Supervisors are misclassified and, as a result of their misclassification, utilized in Atlantic
Theater’s campaign efforts. This is a risk that Atlantic Theater cannot, and should not, be required
