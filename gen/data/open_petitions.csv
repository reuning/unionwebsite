''The Employer hereby recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative for: all Production Department Employees in the Stage Operations, Wardrobe, Hair & Wig, Lighting & Video, Sound, Scene Shop and Properties Departments of Oregon Shakespeare Festival. This Agreement excludes all supervisors, managers, and confidential employees as defined by the National Labor Relations Act and all other OSF employees, including but not limited to resident artistic staff, designers, actors, stage managers, costume shop staff, and administrative staff.

The parties are currently bargaining over terms and conditions of employment for the Costume Department employees.

The original bargaining unit of run crew employees, which includes several classifications in the stage operations, wardrobe, hair & wig, lighting & video, and sound departments, was certified on June 18, 2015 in Case No. 19-RC-150979.
