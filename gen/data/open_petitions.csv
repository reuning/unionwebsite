At this time, no decision has been made regarding whether employees classified as foremen are included or excluded from the bargaining unit, and individuals in these classifications may vote in the election but their ballots shall be challenged since their eligibility has not been determined.

footnote
Also eligible to vote are all employees in the unit(s) who either (1) were employed a total of 30 working days or more within the 12 months preceding the election eligibility date or (2) had some employment in the 12 months preceding the election eligibility date and were employed 45 working days or more within the 24 months immediately preceding the election eligibility date.
