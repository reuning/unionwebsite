the Production Manager, Technical Director, and Lighting Supervisor (the “Identified
Supervisors”), or any other managerial or supervisory employees challenged, from the bargaining
unit. If IATSE objects to the exclusion of the Identified Supervisors from the unit, then Atlantic
Theater requests a hearing and decision on this issue prior to any election. A resolution prior to
any election is critical given the Identified Supervisors’ supervisory responsibilities, and their
necessary involvement in any campaign Atlantic Theater conducts during an election. Atlantic
Theater will not be able to proceed without first confirming the supervisory status of the Identified
Supervisors, due to the potential consequences now articulated in Cemex. That is, the risk of
getting an unfair labor practice charge, and according to Cemex, a bargaining order if the Identified
Supervisors are misclassified and, as a result of their misclassification, utilized in Atlantic

contends that the petitioned-for unit is not appropriate because the unit must include all regular
full-time and part-time employees at the Employer’s venues in the Denver, Colorado Market in
Westminster, Littleton, and Sloan’s Lake.
Alternatively,—even though the Employer argues that American Steel, 372 NLRB No. 23 (2022)
was wrongly decided—assuming the petitioned-for unit does not include all of the Employer’s
regular full-time and part-time employees at the Employer’s venues in the Denver, Colorado
Market in Westminster, Littleton, and Sloan’s Lake, the unit must at least include all regular fulltime
and part-time employees at each individual location because they share an overwhelming
community of interest with the petitioned-for unit. The petitioned-for unit is a deceitful attempt to
create micro-units, resulting in the weakening of labor peace and stability “by the balkanization of
bargaining units in a single, coordinated workplace,” such as the Employer’s venues in the Denver,
Colorado Market. Macy’s, Inc. v. NLRB, No. 15-60022, slip op. at 5 (5th Cir. Nov. 18, 2016)
(citing NLRB v. R. C. Can Co., 328 F.2d 974, 978–79 (5th Cir. 1964)). Further, the Employer
asserts that the overwhelming community of interest standard set forth in American Steel is the
wrong standard and the standard set forth in PCC Structurals, Inc., 365 NLRB No. 160 (2011) is
the correct standard that should be applied.
Moreover, the Employer contends that all Supervisors in the Sloan’s Lake, Westminster, and
Littleton locations must be included in the unit because they are not statutory supervisors under
Section 2(11) of the Act.

Exclude:
Projectionists/Technical Engineers in the Employer’s Sloan’s Lake, Westminster, and Littleton
venues should be excluded from the petitioned-for unit because they constitute a nationwide craft
unit subject to a pending New York/IATSE case. (See 02-RC-319517.) Alternatively, the
Technical Engineers share an overwhelming community of interest among all the Denver market . Technical Engineers and share a separate community of interest from the Front and Back of the
House employees at Sloan’s Lake.
The Employer also contends that all other employees, including, but not limited to, statutory
supervisors, managers, and guards should be excluded, as defined in the Act
