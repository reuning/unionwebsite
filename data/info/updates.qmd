title: Updates to Data

- **2024-05-11**: Data now includes any RM petitions filed after August 25, 2023. These petitions are filed under the new [Cemex](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/board-issues-decision-announcing-new-framework-for-union-representation) decision which provides an alternative avenue for unionization. Under *Cemex* a union can ask for recognition "on the basis that a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit have designated the union as their representative." Employers can then " either recognize and bargain with the union or promptly file an RM petition seeking an election." Currently I am unaware of anyway to track employee asks for recognition that are accepted by the employer.
