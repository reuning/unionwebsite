The data here provides information about elections governed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) since 2008. This data captures private union elections in the United States, and so union elections covering public employees (teachers, police, etc) is not included. The data is automatically updated daily and for more information on some of the limitations read the FAQ.

For each state, I include a plot showing the trends in elections since 2008. There is also information about the largest union elections and any open election related cases. The way the NLRB organizes the data is _unique_ so there are limits to this.

If you have suggestions on additional visualizations please reach out to me at <kevin.reuning@gmail.com>. This was created to help better understand what is happening in the labor movement right now.
